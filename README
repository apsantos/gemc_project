This directory contains all the files needed to run a short Gibbs Ensemble
simulation of LJ particle at temperature T=2

I. FILES REQUIRED TO RUN THE SIMULATION

lj.pdb
    Molecular configuration. Not very interesting for monotonics

lj.mcf
    Molecular force field information.

gemc_lj.inp
    The initial density for the liquid and vapor phases were chosen to be close
    to the final density.

species1/
    Fragment file directory. Not very interesting for monotonics

II. RUNNING THE SIMULATION

The simulation can be run with the following command:

> $CASSANDRA_DIR/Src/cassandra_gfortran.exe gemc_lj.inp

--or--
If installed using conda:
conda activate cassandra
(cassandra) % cassandra.exe gemc_lj.inp

III. OUTPUT FILES

All output files are named gemc_lj.* , as defined in the input file. Please 
see the Cassandra manual for more information on each output file type.

*H box H matrix

IV. Plotting files
plt_rho-mcsteps.plg
   run like: gnuplot plt_rho-mcsteps.plg
   You may have to change the file names from gemc_lj.out.box1.prp to something different
